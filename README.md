# How do I use changeloggr?

Download the project, put it somewhere in your website's files, and paste this code somewhere in your html code. File should point at your changelog file:

`<script src="changeloggr.js?file=CHANGELOG.md"></script>`

## That's it!

Out of the box, it shows a modal dialog on the right side of your web page, showing the formatted MarkDown changelog. You can easily extend the provided CSS or create a new theme.
Your users will see the modal only once, until your next update to the changelog file.
